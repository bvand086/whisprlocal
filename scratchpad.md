# macOS Transcription App Development Log

## Project Overview
Building a macOS menu bar app that provides real-time audio transcription using Whisper.cpp with Core ML support, optimized for Apple Silicon (M2).

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Core Setup & Model Integration
- [x] Create new Xcode project
- [x] Configure project settings (Hardened Runtime, App Sandbox, etc.)
- [x] Add SwiftWhisper package dependency
- [x] Implement model loading and management
- [x] Test basic model loading with a sample GGML model

### Phase 2: Audio Capture
- [ ] Set up AVFoundation audio session
- [ ] Implement AudioRecorder class
- [ ] Test audio capture and format conversion
- [ ] Add proper error handling for audio permissions

### Phase 3: Transcription Engine
- [ ] Integrate Whisper transcription
- [ ] Implement audio buffer processing
- [ ] Add transcription result handling
- [ ] Test end-to-end transcription flow

### Phase 4: UI & System Integration
- [x] Create menu bar interface
- [ ] Add HotKey support
- [x] Implement preferences window
- [ ] Add clipboard integration
- [ ] Create notification system

### Phase 5: Model Management
- [x] Add model download functionality
- [x] Implement model switching
- [x] Add model storage management
- [x] Create model selection UI

### Phase 6: Logging & Error Handling
- [ ] Implement transcription logging
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling
- [x] Create user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Add debug logging system

### Phase 7: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile CPU/GPU usage
- [ ] Optimize memory management
- [ ] Test with different model sizes
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring

## Current Status
Completed Phase 1 and most of Phase 5. Next steps:
1. Implement audio capture system
2. Set up AVFoundation audio session
3. Create AudioRecorder class

Would you like to proceed with the audio capture implementation?
