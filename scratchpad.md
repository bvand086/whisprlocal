# macOS Transcription App Development Log

## Project Overview
Building a macOS menu bar app that provides real-time audio transcription using Whisper.cpp with Core ML support, optimized for Apple Silicon (M2).

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Core Setup & Model Integration
- [x] Create new Xcode project
- [x] Configure project settings (Hardened Runtime, App Sandbox, etc.)
- [x] Add SwiftWhisper package dependency
- [x] Implement model loading and management
- [x] Test basic model loading with a sample GGML model
- [ ] Fix Core ML model loading issues
- [ ] Add model validation checks
- [ ] Implement proper model path handling

### Phase 2: Audio Capture
- [ ] Set up AVFoundation audio session
- [ ] Implement AudioRecorder class
- [ ] Test audio capture and format conversion
- [ ] Add proper error handling for audio permissions

### Phase 3: Transcription Engine
- [ ] Integrate Whisper transcription
- [ ] Implement audio buffer processing
- [ ] Add transcription result handling
- [ ] Test end-to-end transcription flow

### Phase 4: UI & System Integration
- [x] Create menu bar interface
- [ ] Add HotKey support
- [x] Implement preferences window
- [ ] Add clipboard integration
- [ ] Create notification system

### Phase 5: Model Management
- [x] Add model download functionality
- [x] Implement model switching
- [x] Add model storage management
- [x] Create model selection UI

### Phase 6: Logging & Error Handling
- [ ] Implement transcription logging
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling
- [x] Create user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Add debug logging system

### Phase 7: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile CPU/GPU usage
- [ ] Optimize memory management
- [ ] Test with different model sizes
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring

## Current Status
Completed Phase 1 partially, but encountered issues:
1. Core ML model loading failure
2. Model path resolution problems
3. Unexpected language detection (detected Chinese for English model)

Next steps:
1. Fix Core ML model integration
   - Verify Core ML model conversion
   - Implement proper model path validation
   - Add error recovery mechanisms
2. Implement audio capture system
3. Add model validation checks
4. Set up AVFoundation audio session

### Known Issues
1. Core ML model not found at expected path
2. Initial model loading failures
3. Window snapshot errors in UI
4. Factory registration error for UUID

Would you like me to help with implementing the Core ML fixes or proceed with the audio capture implementation?
